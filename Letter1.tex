Title:

Searching for post-doc position

Content:

Dear Dr. ??':

Hello. My name is Yadong Jiang, a PhD candidate of IUSS, Pavia. I am writing this email to introduce myself and find the possibility to work in your group as a post-doc.

My major is Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology, ROSE Programme. And now I am at the final stage of my PhD period. The doctoral dissertation had been submitted and now I am waiting for the final defence. My doctoral topic is about the seismic performance assessment of concrete-filled steel tubes, which involved both experimental tests and numerical modelling. The details of my PhD work could be found in my CV, which is attached in this email. 

As approaching the end of my PhD life, I am searching for a post-doc position as a continuation of my academic career. And regarding my post-doc position, I want to continue my research in seismic field. 

And looking forward to your kind reply.

Thank you very much and have a nice day.

Best regards

Yadong Jiang
