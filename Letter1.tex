Title:

Searching for post-doc position

Content:

Dear Dr. ??':

Hello. My name is Yadong Jiang, a PhD candidate of IUSS, Pavia. My major is Earthquake Engnieering and Engineering Seismology, ROSE Programme. Currently I had submitted the my doctoral dissertation and waiting for the final defense (which will be approxiately held in Janurary or Feburary 2018).  I am looking for a post-doc position as a continuation of my research career.

My doctoral topic is about the seismic performance of concrete-filled steel tubes, which involves both experimental tests and numerical modelling. The details of PhD work could be found in my CV, which is attached in this email.

And looking forward to your kind reply.

Thank you very much and have a nice day.

best regards

Yadong Jiang
